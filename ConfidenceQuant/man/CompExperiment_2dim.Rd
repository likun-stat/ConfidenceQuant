  tau = 0.25, lambda = 2, D = 50, b1 = ceiling(nrow(treatment)^0.6),
  b2 = ceiling(nrow(control)^0.6), s = 15, r = 100, Search = FALSE)

}
\arguments{
\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel execution. If not
specified, the number of cores is set to the value of
\code{options("cores")}, if specified, or to one-half the number of cores
detected by the \code{\link{parallel}} package.}

\item{treatment}{A 3-dim optional data frame for the treatment group (or
object coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing
the variables in the model. The last column of this data frame must be the
response for the experiment.}

\item{control}{A 3-dim optional data frame for the control group (or object
coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing the
variables in the model. The last column of this data frame must be the
response for the experiment.}

\item{alpha}{The confidence level required. The default is 0.05.}

\item{tau}{A specific quantile to be estimated. Must be a number between 0 and
1.}

\item{lambda}{The smoothing parameter used for \code{treatment} &
\code{control} if \eqn{Search=FALSE}, which governs the tradeoff between
fidelity and the penalty component for the triogram term.}

\item{D}{A number that determines the density of a grid of x values at which
the quantile function will be predicted. If specified, it will evaluate a
confidence surface on a \eqn{DÃ—D} grid.}

\item{b1}{The subsample size in the BLB algorithm for \code{treatment}.
Kleiner et al. suggest that the size should be around \eqn{n1^0.6}, where
\eqn{n1} is the data size for \code{treatment}.}

\item{b2}{The subsample size in the BLB algorithm for \code{control}. It is
also suggested that the size should be around \eqn{n2^0.6}, where \eqn{n2}
is the data size for \code{control}.}

\item{s}{The number of subsamples used in the BLB algorithm. Kleiner et al.
suggest that \eqn{s} should be 10~20.}

\item{r}{The number of bootstrap iterations (samples with with replacement).
\eqn{r=100} is suggested.}

\item{xlab, ylab, zlab}{Titles for the axises. See \code{\link{title}}.}
}
\value{
A list with three parts - \code{result1}, \code{result2}, and
 \code{Diff}, which respectively return confidence bands for
 \code{treatment}, \code{control} and the difference between the two dataset.
 Each part includes the following:

 1. \code{x0} and \code{CI_average}, where \code{x0} contains the x values at
 which the confidence intervals are evaluated, and \code{CI_average} is 2-dim
 matrix which contains the corresponding lower and upper bounds.

 2. \code{lambda}, which is the optimum smoothing parameter selected by
 \code{BLB_rqss_2dim}. If it is done automatically, the function also returns
 \code{Lambda} and \code{Fid}, which respectively stand for a vector of lambda
 values and their corresponding cross-validation MCV values.
}
\description{
\code{CompExperiment_2dim} compares the confidence regions for a given
quantile for two different datasets, one related to a treatment and the other
to a control. It applies the BLB algorithm to each dataset to get confidence
regions using quantile smoothing splines for 2-dim covariate.

\code{searchLambda_2dim} is a wrapper function to calculate the optimum lambda.

\code{CompPlot_2dim} is a function to plot the results.
}
\details{
This function runs \code{BLB} twice, once for each dataset. It is based on
\code{\link{BLB_rqss_2dim}}, which implements BLB for quantile smoothing splines
with a two-dimensional covariate dataset. It performs parallelization to speed
up the calculation.

\code{CompPlot_2dim} takes the results and use ggplot/plotly to visualize
them, in which different colors represent different scenarios. See figure
above.
