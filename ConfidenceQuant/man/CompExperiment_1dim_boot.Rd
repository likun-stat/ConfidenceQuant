\usage{
CompExperiment_1dim_boot(cores = NULL, treatment, control, alpha = 0.05,
  tau = 0.25, lambda = 2, D = 100, B = 100, Search = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel execution. If not
specified, the number of cores is set to the value of
\code{options("cores")}, if specified, or to one-half the number of cores
detected by the \code{\link{parallel}} package.}

\item{treatment}{A 2-dim optional data frame for the treatment group (or
object coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing
the variables in the model. The last column of this data frame must be the
response for the experiment.}

\item{control}{A 2-dim optional data frame for the control group (or object
coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing the
variables in the model. The last column of this data frame must be the
response for the experiment.}

\item{alpha}{The confidence level required. The default is 0.05.}

\item{tau}{A specific quantile to be estimated. Must be a number between 0 and
1.}

\item{lambda}{The smoothing parameter governing the tradeoff between fidelity
and the penalty component for the triogram term. If \code{Search=TRUE},
there is no need for users to specify a value.}

\item{D}{A number that specifies how many x values you want to examine the
confidence bands at. If specified, we will look at \eqn{D} equal-distanced
points.}

\item{B}{The number of Monte Carlo iterations using bootstrap with
replacement. \eqn{B=100} is by default.}

\item{Search}{If \code{TRUE} (which is recommended), then the function will
first search for an optimum smoothing parameter \eqn{\lambda}.}
}
\value{
A list with three parts - \code{result1}, \code{result2}, and
 \code{Diff}, which respectively return confidence bands for
 \code{treatment}, \code{control} and the difference between the two dataset.
 Each part includes the following:

 1. \code{x0} and \code{CI_average}, where \code{x0} contains the x values at
 which the confidence intervals are evaluated, and \code{CI_average} is 2-dim
 matrix which contains the corresponding lower and upper bounds.

 2. \code{lambda}, which is the optimum smoothing parameter selected by
 \code{BLB_rqss}. If it is done automatically, the function also returns
 \code{Lambda} and \code{Fid}, which respectively stand for a vector of lambda
 values and their corresponding cross-validation MCV values.
}
\description{
\code{CompExperiment_1dim_boot} compares the confidence bands at a given
quantile for two different datasets, one related to a treatment and the other
to a control. It applies the regular bootstrap algorithm to each dataset to
get confidence bands using quantile smoothing splines for 1-dim covariate.
}
\details{
This function runs \code{Bootstrap} twice, once for each dataset. It is based
on \code{\link{Bootstrap_rqss}}, which implements regular bootstrap for
quantile smoothing splines with one dimensional covariate dataset. It
performs parallelization to speed up the calculation.

This function can also return a colored contour plot, in which different
colors represent different scenarios. See figure above.
